# Winter Hush
**Issue #1 - A TinyTUI Experience**

A quiet, contemplative experience of ASCII snow drifting down the terminal. Catch snowflakes to reveal fragments of text.

## The Experience

Winter Hush invites you into a peaceful terminal snowfall. Move your cursor (represented by `^`) left and right to catch falling snowflakes. Some snowflakes carry hidden text fragments - poetic whispers that reveal themselves when caught.

## Controls

- `←` `→` - Move left and right to catch snowflakes
- `q` - Quit the experience

## Themes

This issue explores:
- **Quietude** - The meditative quality of falling snow
- **Hidden meaning** - Text fragments revealed through interaction
- **Seasonal contemplation** - Winter as a time for reflection
- **Minimalist interaction** - Simple controls, deep experience

## Technical Notes

- Uses the Winter theme from TinyKit (ice blues and whites)
- Real-time animation with threaded input handling
- Procedural snowflake generation with drift physics
- Fragment collection and display system

## Running

```bash
python issues/winter-hush/main.py
```
