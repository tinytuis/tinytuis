# tinytuis

a collection of tiny terminal user interfaces.

## overview

this repository is for experiments.  
each tui is isolated, with its own code and readme.  
patterns are extracted into their own directory when useful.

## layout

- `/experiments` — small tui programs  
- `/patterns` — reusable components  
- `/docs` — notes and learnings  
- `/site` — project website

## principles

- keep things small  
- prefer clarity over features  
- record what you learn

## contributing

each experiment should declare its learning goal at the top of its readme.  
pull requests are welcome.
