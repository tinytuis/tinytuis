# tinytuis

tiny, useful terminal interfaces - built to learn, share, and reuse.

## overview

this is a playground for terminal user interface (TUI) creations.  
each program is isolated, with its own readme and demo.  
patterns that repeat are extracted into `/patterns`.

## principles

- keep things small  
- prefer clarity over features  
- record what you learn  
- reuse patterns when they repeat  
- write code others can read
