# tinytuis

tiny, useful terminal interfaces - built to learn, share, and reuse.

## overview

this is a playground for terminal user interface (TUI) creations.  
each program is isolated, with its own readme and demo.  
patterns that repeat are extracted into `/patterns`.

## quick start

coming soon

## layout

- `/projects` — standalone TUI experiments
- `/patterns` — shared design patterns

## principles

- keep things small: focus drives progress, keeps it fun 
- prefer clarity: readable code beats clever tricks
- record what you learn: docs as lessons (goals, wins, gotchas)
- reuse patterns: extract to `/patterns` for efficiency
- write readable code: standards-first, cross-terminal ready
